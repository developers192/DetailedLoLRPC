This project was created as a replacement for League of Legends' outdated Discord Rich Presence.

## Features
- Display your current skin instead of default splash arts
- Updated splash arts for outdated ones
- Proper splash arts for newer champions
- More detailed mode texts (Ranked Solo/Duo/Flex, TFT Double Up, ...)

And many more ...

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To start using DetailedLoLRPC, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Windows 7 and above
- League of Legends
- Discord


### Installation & Usage

1. Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/developers192/DetailedLoLRPC/releases/latest) (It might be flagged by your antivirus, whitelist it if that's the case)
2. Make sure LoL is not running. Run `DetailedLoLRPC.exe`
3. If the Riot Client is not running, you'll have to manually specify the required path.
4. League of Legends will now automatically run with its Rich Presence replaced with DetailedLoLRPC.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Options

You can right click the tray icon to toggle various settings:
- "Use skin's splash and name": Display the current skin's splash and name on Discord. If disabled, default skin and champion name will be used instead.
- "Show "View splash art" button": Display a button on Discord that allows viewing the current skin's splash.
- "Idle status": Choose an idling status to show on Discord (If this doesn't update first try, you can try creating and leaving a lobby)
- "Reset preferences": Reset all settings to their default values. You have to use this if you want to move your Riot Games folder to another directory.
- "Report bug": Open the the page to report a bug and the folder containing the necessary logs.
- "Exit": Exit DetailedLoLRPC (LoL's native RPC will not be re-enabled until the next time you start LoL using the Riot Client)

If you change any settings while in the middle of a game, they will be applied the next time you start a game.

## Disclaimer
- I will not hold responsibility for any bans caused by DetailedLoLRPC. (In theory it won't happen because DetailedLoLRPC only uses the API provided by the Client itself. Although it does tamper with the `plugin-manifest.json` file to disable the native RPC, I think it's [fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/awedjv/there_is_a_way_to_make_the_client/))
